    "4": "Citrus fruits are one of the largest fruit crops in the world. About 30% of citrus fruits are processed to obtain various products, mainly juice (Figure 4). Similarly, the citrus industry is also the second-largest fruit-processing industry, surpassed again by the grape industry, which mainly produces wine. Neither orange juice nor wine can be considered essential foods, but they do have an important role in our lives. Although citrus fruits have been consumed since ancient times, citrus processing, as it is known today, was not possible until thermal treatment (to inactivate enzymes and microorganisms) and concentration processes were commercially available. Since then, the citrus industry has developed rapidly, becoming prominent among food industries (Izquierdo et al., 2013).",
