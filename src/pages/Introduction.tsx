                            Socio-scientific issues are complex and contentious
                            societal issues with substantive connections to
                            scientific ideas and principles. The context of SSI
                            in learning begins in the nearby neighborhood and
                            has reality and meaning in everyday life. SSI is
                            chosen as a context for learning because it may be
                            utilized to make students' science education more
                            relevant while also enhancing their capacity to
                            analyze scientific data. One of the socio-scientific
                            issues that is used in this proposed research is the
                            CVPD disease issue that has been attacking citrus
                            crops in several plantations at Kintamani, Bangli,
                            Indonesia. This issue has become one of the local
                            environmental issues that is not only happening in
                            Bali but also in other areas of Indonesia. In order
                            to help the farmers control the CVPD disease, it is
                            crucial to provide them with enough information on
                            how to comprehend all control techniques. It entails
                            providing information on how to prevent and manage
                            the insect vectors that transmit this CVPD disease.
                            Incorporating knowledge and data regarding the
                            identification of CVPD disease vectors into a
                            learning module is one of the effective methods. The
                            designed SSIbased learning module can inform
                            students about current local issues occurring in
                            their surroundings. In addition to presenting
                            knowledge about the CVPD and the CPVD-carrying
                            insect vectors, students will be encouraged to
                            utilize their critical thinking abilities to analyze
                            the module's content in order to comprehend the CVPD
                            disease's control strategies. Lastly, the students
                            can also share any useful information from the
                            module to educate the local farmers about the vector
                            insect control that can be used as one strategy to
                            cope with the CPVD disease, which has been harming
                            the plantation yields of local farmers. This SSI

                            Did you know that CPVD disease is a major cause of
                            yield loss in citrus plantations in almost all
                            countries, especially in Asia and Africa? Citrus is
                            one of the commodities that plays an important role
                            in the economy and the welfare of farmers. On the
                            other hand, CVPD disease is still a problem in
                            citrus plantations, which affects the environment.
                            With the help of this module, we will discover these
                            issues in CVPD disease in citrus plantations in four
                            sections. This module is divided into four sections,
                            the majority of which concern the CVPD disease in
                            citrus plantations in Kintamani, Bali. The first
                            section will begin with an encounter with a focal
                            issue using socio-scientific issue teaching and
                            learning. This section will define CVPD and explain
                            how dangerous it is in citrus plantations. In this
                            section, you will also discover the other
                            problematic issue in the citrus plantations of Bali.
                            In the second section, this module will help you
                            engage in three-dimensional learning related to CVPD
                            disease in citrus plantations. You will discover
                            disciplinary core ideas, cross-cutting concepts, and
                            science practice in these socioscientific issues.
                            Following that, you will discover a possible
                            solution for preventing CVPD disease attacks on
                            citrus (including evaluation and reflection) through
                            Integrated Management of Healthy Citrus. In the last
                            section, the concept of sustainable development is
                            introduced, and the relationship between Integrated
                            Management of Healthy Citrus and sustainable
